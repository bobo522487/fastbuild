## Failed Items

1. **Epic Alignment Matrix missing**
   Impact: No documented mapping between epics and components, reduces traceability
   Evidence: No separate epic alignment matrix file explicitly mentioned

2. **Separate tech-spec files missing**
   Impact: Each epic should have dedicated technical specification documents
   Evidence: Document does not explicitly mention tech-spec-epic-{{N}}.md files

3. **Cohesion check report missing**
   Impact: No documented validation of requirement coverage and cohesion analysis
   Evidence: Not explicitly mentioned as separate file

4. **User skill level not documented**
   Impact: Architecture may not be appropriately targeted to user expertise level
   Evidence: Not explicitly documented in solution architecture

5. **Technical preferences not captured**
   Impact: Architecture decisions may not align with user preferences
   Evidence: Not explicitly recorded in solution architecture

## Partial Items

1. **Development tools configuration status**
   Missing: Specific status of testing framework and Git Hooks configuration
   Evidence: Technology stack versions are specific, but development tools section has "待配置" entries

2. **Story readiness percentage not specified**
   Missing: Explicit percentage or count of story readiness
   Evidence: Document mentions story readiness but no specific percentage provided

3. **NFR explicit separation**
   Missing: Non-functional requirements not clearly separated from technical considerations
   Evidence: Technical stack and architecture principles cover NFRs but not explicitly separated

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (Critical Failures)
1. **Generate Epic Alignment Matrix**: Create separate epic-alignment-matrix.md file mapping each epic to components and requirements
2. **Create Tech-Spec Documents**: Generate tech-spec-epic-1.md through tech-spec-epic-5.md for each epic
3. **Produce Cohesion Check Report**: Create cohesion-check-report.md documenting validation results
4. **Document User Skill Level**: Add user skill level analysis to architecture document
5. **Capture Technical Preferences**: Record user technical preferences in architecture document

### Should Improve (Important Gaps)
1. **Specify Story Readiness**: Add explicit percentage or count of story readiness
2. **Complete Development Tools Plan**: Provide specific timeline for testing framework and Git hooks configuration
3. **Separate NFRs**: Create explicit section for non-functional requirements separate from technical decisions

### Consider (Minor Improvements)
1. **Add Architecture Decision Records**: Consider creating ADR files for major technical decisions
2. **Enhance Traceability**: Add cross-references between epics, requirements, and technical components
3. **Add Implementation Timeline**: Provide rough timeline for epic implementation sequence

## Validation Summary

The solution architecture document is comprehensive and well-structured with strong technical foundations. The architecture decisions are sound and well-justified with specific technology versions. However, several critical deliverables are missing as separate files, particularly the Epic Alignment Matrix, individual Tech-Spec documents, and Cohesion Check Report. These files are essential for implementation readiness and should be generated to complete the solution architecture workflow.
