# Project Workflow Analysis Validation Report

**Document:** /home/bobo/project/test/fastbuild/docs/project-workflow-analysis.md
**Checklist:** /home/bobo/project/test/fastbuild/bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/correct-course/checklist.md
**Date:** 2025-10-10

## Summary
- Overall: 8/15 passed (53%)
- Critical Issues: 4 data inconsistencies found

## Section Results

### Project Classification Accuracy
Pass Rate: 3/3 (100%)

✅ PASS - Project type correctly identified
Evidence: "Web应用程序 - 无代码开发平台" (line 11)

✅ PASS - Project level correctly identified
Evidence: "Level 2 (小型完整系统)" (line 12)

✅ PASS - Instruction set correctly selected
Evidence: "instructions-med.md" (line 13)

### Scope Summary Accuracy
Pass Rate: 0/4 (0%)

❌ FAIL - Story estimate inconsistent with PRD
Evidence: Document claims "25-35 stories" (line 18) but PRD clearly states "5-15 stories" (line 7)
Impact: Resource planning and timeline estimation will be based on incorrect data

❌ FAIL - Epic estimate inconsistent with PRD
Evidence: Document claims "5 epics" (line 19) but PRD clearly states "1-2 epics" (line 7)
Impact: Team structure and milestone planning will be inaccurate

❌ FAIL - Timeline doesn't match project level
Evidence: "3-4 months" (line 20) is too long for a Level 2 project
Impact: Expectation management doesn't match actual delivery capability

⚠ PARTIAL - Brief description mostly accurate
Evidence: Description mostly consistent with PRD content (line 17)
Missing: Inaccurate numerical ranges

### Context Accuracy
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

✅ PASS - Greenfield/Brownfield correctly identified
Evidence: "Brownfield - 添加到现有的清洁代码库" (line 24)

✅ PASS - Existing documentation status correct
Evidence: "完整的产品需求文档" (line 25)

✅ PASS - Team size reasonable
Evidence: "小团队 (2-5人)" (line 26)

✅ PASS - Deployment intent correct
Evidence: "MVP for early users" (line 27)

### Workflow Path Recommendation
Pass Rate: 1/4 (25%)

✅ PASS - Primary outputs well-defined
Evidence: Lists PRD, Epic breakdown, Tech specs, UX specs (lines 33-36)

❌ FAIL - Workflow sequence has logical issues
Evidence: Claims "当前阶段: PRD工作流程" (line 40) but PRD phase is already complete
Impact: Routing decision based on outdated status information

⚠ PARTIAL - Next step recommendation incomplete
Evidence: "下一步: 解决方案设计工作流程" (line 41) is correct but lacks conditions
Missing: Should be based on validation results to decide solution design entry

➖ N/A - Tech specs and UX specs generation
Reason: These are future outputs, not part of current analysis

### Content Boundary Issues
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

❌ FAIL - Contains architectural decisions that shouldn't be in this document
Evidence: Lines 59-68 "技术偏好" include detailed technology stack choices
Impact: Blurs responsibility boundaries between project analysis and architecture design
Recommendation: This content should be determined in solution architecture phase

## Failed Items

1. **Data inconsistency** - Story count, epic count don't match PRD
2. **Timeline mismatch** - 3-4 months is too long for Level 2 project
3. **Outdated workflow status** - PRD phase is already complete
4. **Boundary confusion** - Contains architectural decision content

## Partial Items

1. **Brief description** - Content accurate but numerical ranges wrong
2. **Next step recommendation** - Direction correct but lacks validation-based conditions

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
1. **Sync with PRD data** - Use accurate numbers from PRD (5-15 stories, 1-2 epics)
2. **Adjust timeline** - Level 2 project should be 1-2 months
3. **Update workflow status** - PRD phase complete, should enter solution design
4. **Remove architectural content** - Delete technical preferences section

### Should Improve
1. **Strengthen routing logic** - Clear conditional routing based on validation results
2. **Add data source references** - Clearly cite sources for all data
3. **Clarify decision rationale** - Explain why Level 2 classification was made

## Next Steps

Based on validation results, this document requires significant corrections before it can reliably route subsequent workflows. The data inconsistencies must be resolved to prevent cascading errors in planning and resource allocation.

**Priority: HIGH** - Fix before proceeding to solution architecture workflow.
