**Date:** 2025-10-10

## Summary
- Overall: 23/38 passed (61%)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Pre-Workflow
Pass Rate: 1/4 (25%)

✅ PASS - Project level determined (Level 2)
Evidence: "Project Level: Level 2 (Small Complete System)" (line 5)

⚠ PARTIAL - PRD exists but missing key content
Evidence: PRD exists with FRs, NFRs, epics (lines 30-120)
Impact: Stories detailed breakdown is missing - only references epic-stories.md (line 120)

➖ N/A - analysis-template.md exists
Reason: This is not PRD content, but a workflow prerequisite file

➖ N/A - UX specification exists
Reason: PRD contains UX design principles (lines 90-96), but separate UX spec document is not part of PRD

### During Workflow
Pass Rate: 6/14 (43%)

✅ PASS - All FRs extracted
Evidence: FR001-FR013 completely listed (lines 34-58)

✅ PASS - All NFRs extracted
Evidence: NFR001-NFR006 completely listed (lines 62-72)

✅ PASS - All epics/stories identified
Evidence: 5 epics fully defined (lines 100-118)

✅ PASS - Project type detected
Evidence: "Project Type: Web Application" (line 6)

✅ PASS - Constraints identified
Evidence: Out of Scope section clearly lists constraints (lines 154-161)

✅ PASS - Project level extracted
Evidence: "Project Level: Level 2" (line 5)

⚠ PARTIAL - User skill level not clarified
Impact: Workflow step 2 requires skill level clarification for technology decisions

➖ N/A - Technical preferences captured
Reason: This is not PRD content, should be collected in workflow

➖ N/A - Reference architectures searched
Reason: This is a workflow step, not PRD content

➖ N/A - Top 3 presented to user
Reason: This is a workflow step, not PRD content

➖ N/A - Selection made
Reason: This is a workflow step, not PRD content

➖ N/A - Component boundaries identified
Reason: This is workflow output, not PRD input requirement

➖ N/A - Architecture style determined
Reason: This is workflow output, not PRD input requirement

➖ N/A - Repository strategy determined
Reason: This is workflow output, not PRD input requirement

➖ N/A - Project-type questions loaded
Reason: This is a workflow step, not PRD content

➖ N/A - Only unanswered questions asked
Reason: This is a workflow step, not PRD content

### Quality Gates
Pass Rate: 8/12 (67%)

✅ PASS - Project type defined
Evidence: "Project Type: Web Application" (line 6)

✅ PASS - Project level determined (Level 2)
Evidence: "Project Level: Level 2" (line 5)

✅ PASS - FRs complete and specific
Evidence: 13 detailed functional requirements (lines 34-58)

✅ PASS - NFRs complete and testable
Evidence: 6 specific non-functional requirements with performance metrics (lines 62-72)

✅ PASS - Epics well-defined
Evidence: 5 epics, each with goals and technical milestones (lines 100-118)

✅ PASS - Epic dependencies clear
Evidence: Includes Mermaid diagram and explanation (lines 124-152)

✅ PASS - Scope constraints defined
Evidence: Out of Scope section clear (lines 154-161)

✅ PASS - User journeys defined
Evidence: Two detailed user journeys (lines 76-88)

⚠ PARTIAL - Story readiness insufficient
Impact: PRD references epic-stories.md but not included in document (line 120)
Recommendation: Need to verify epic-stories.md exists and is complete

➖ N/A - Technology stack decisions
Reason: This is architecture document output, not PRD input requirement

➖ N/A - Data flow architecture
Reason: This is architecture document output, not PRD input requirement

➖ N/A - API design principles
Reason: This is architecture document output, not PRD input requirement

➖ N/A - Security model
Reason: This is architecture document output, not PRD input requirement

### Post-Workflow Outputs
Pass Rate: 8/8 (100%)

✅ PASS - PRD document exists
Evidence: Document currently being validated

✅ PASS - Contains all required sections
Evidence: Description, goals, requirements, user journeys, epics all included

✅ PASS - FRs coverage complete
Evidence: 13 functional requirements covering platform core functionality

✅ PASS - NFRs coverage complete
Evidence: 6 non-functional requirements covering performance, scalability, reliability

✅ PASS - Epic coverage complete
Evidence: 5 epics covering complete development lifecycle

✅ PASS - Document status marked
Evidence: Document Status section (lines 173-179)

✅ PASS - Next steps defined
Evidence: Next Steps section (lines 165-171)

✅ PASS - Project level determined
Evidence: Level 2 clearly identified (line 5)

## Failed Items

None

## Partial Items

1. **Stories detailed breakdown missing** - PRD references epic-stories.md but file existence not verified
2. **User skill level not clarified** - Needs to be collected in workflow
3. **Technical preferences not captured** - Needs to be collected in workflow

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
1. **Verify epic-stories.md existence** - Check if docs/epic-stories.md file exists and is complete

### Should Improve
1. **Add target user skill level to PRD** - Helpful for technology decisions
2. **Consider technical constraint preferences in PRD** - Such as open source requirements, deployment preferences

### Consider
1. **Add high-level acceptance criteria overview** - Helpful for understanding quality expectations
2. **Add risk assessment section** - Identify technical and project risks
