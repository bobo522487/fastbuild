- **Target Market**: Internal business applications for SMEs

### Technology Justifications

#### Next.js 15.5.4
- **Rationale**: Latest features with stable ecosystem
- **Benefits**: SSR/SSG flexibility, excellent TypeScript support, Vercel optimization
- **Trade-offs**: Framework lock-in, but acceptable for benefits

#### REST API with OpenAPI 3.0
- **Rationale**: Standard HTTP contracts with automatic documentation
- **Benefits**: Universal compatibility, excellent tooling support, clear contracts
- **Trade-offs**: Less type safety than tRPC but better interoperability

#### Prisma 6.17.0
- **Rationale**: Type-safe database access with excellent migration tools
- **Benefits**: Auto-generated types, schema-first design, excellent DX
- **Trade-offs**: Abstraction layer, but worth it for type safety

#### shadcn/ui + Radix UI
- **Rationale**: High-quality, accessible components with customization
- **Benefits**: Professional UI, accessibility compliance, TypeScript support
- **Trade-offs**: Learning curve for component composition

#### PostgreSQL + JSONB
- **Rationale**: Relational reliability with NoSQL flexibility
- **Benefits**: ACID compliance, JSONB indexing, proven reliability
- **Trade-offs**: Single database vendor lock-in
